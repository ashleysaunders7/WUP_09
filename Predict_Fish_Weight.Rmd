# Predicting Fish Weight
```{r}
fish <- read.csv(file = "Fish.csv")
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
 
fish <- fish %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
levels(fish$Species)
Bream <- filter(fish, Species == "Bream")
Bream <- select(Bream, -Species) 
Parkki <- filter(fish, Species == "Parkki")
Parkki <- select(Parkki, -Species) 
Perch <- filter(fish, Species == "Perch")
Perch <- select(Perch, -Species) 
Pike <- filter(fish, Species == "Pike")
Pike <- select(Pike, -Species) 
Roach <- filter(fish, Species == "Roach")
Roach <- select(Roach, -Species) 
Smelt <- filter(fish, Species == "Smelt")
Smelt <- select(Smelt, -Species) 
Whitefish <- filter(fish, Species == "Whitefish")
Whitefish <- select(Whitefish, -Species) 
```



## Perch
```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottom",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

This demonstrates that the ideal model is Height and Width. The best models can be tested further.
